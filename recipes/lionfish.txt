Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Ingredients:

2 pieces taro
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1 medium red bell pepper
3/4 lb. pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

Servings: 8

Directions:

2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
4. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
6. After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper.
7. Put-in the sinigang mix
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
