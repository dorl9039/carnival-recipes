Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Servings: 8

1 (28 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
1 medium red bell pepper
3/4 lb. pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)


4. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.
6. After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
10. Stir to combine, place a lid on top, and allow the pasta to cook in the pepper sauce for about 5 more minutes, or until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot.
11. Add about a half teaspoon of salt, taste, and add more if needed.
